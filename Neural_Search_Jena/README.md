Neural Search with Jina AI [online-workshop]


Image search with Docarray (a product from Jina).
- The AI-based image search engine that can run on the local machine
- A plugin to retrieve images/audio/video/text without searching google 
- Search is done with neural networks
It creates embeddings of images using CNN i.e. Transforms the data into a vector independent of the initial data type. These vectors are then indexed in vector space. A new unseen data point is transferred to the vector and matched to vector space for correct indexing. In short neural search use embedding to find the nearest representation of a given data point.
